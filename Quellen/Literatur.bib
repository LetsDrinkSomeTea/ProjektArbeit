abstract="Recent advancements in digital technologies have significantly increased the quality and capability to produce realistic images and videos using highly advanced computer graphics and AI algorithms due to which it becomes difficult to distinguish between the real media and fake media. These computer-generated images or videos have useful applications in real life; however, these can also lead to various threats related to privacy and security. Deepfake is one of the ways which can lead to these threats. Term ``Deepfake'' is combination of two terms ``deep learning'' and ``fake.`` Using deepfake, anyone can replace or mask someone else face on another person's face in an image or a video. Not only this, deepfake can change the original voice and facial expressions also in an image or a video. Nowadays, deepfake uses techniques like deep learning and AI to replace the original face, voice, or expressions. It is very hard for a human to detect that the content has been manipulated by deepfake techniques. This paper has attempted to introduce this concept of deepfake and has also discussed different types of deepfakes. The paper has also discussed methods to create and detect deepfake. The motivation behind this paper is to make the society aware about the deepfake tricks along with the treats offered by it.",

	abstract = {Novel digital technologies make it increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and fake media. One of the most recent developments contributing to the problem is the emergence of deepfakes which are hyper-realistic videos that apply artificial intelligence (AI) to depict someone say and do things that never happened. Coupled with the reach and speed of social media, convincing deepfakes can quickly reach millions of people and have negative impacts on our society. While scholarly research on the topic is sparse, this study analyzes 84 publicly available online news articles to examine what deepfakes are and who produces them, what the benefits and threats of deepfake technology are, what examples of deepfakes there are, and how to combat deepfakes. The results suggest that while deepfakes are a significant threat to our society, political system and business, they can be combatted via legislation and regulation, corporate policies and voluntary action, education and training, as well as the development of technology for deepfake detection, content authentication, and deepfake prevention. The study provides a comprehensive review of deepfakes and provides cybersecurity and AI entrepreneurs with business opportunities in fighting against media forgeries and fake news.},

  abstract  = {Deepfakes are extremely realistic audio/video media. They are produced via a complex machine-learning process, one that centrally involves training an algorithm on hundreds or thousands of audio/video recordings of an object or person, S, with the aim of either creating entirely new audio/video media of S or else altering existing audio/video media of S. Deepfakes are widely predicted to have deleterious consequences (principally, moral and epistemic ones) for both individuals and various of our social practices and institutions. In this introduction to the Topical Collection, I first survey existing philosophical research on deepfakes (Sects. 2 and 3). I then give an overview of the papers that comprise the Collection (Sect. 4). Finally, I conclude with remarks on a line of argument made in a number of papers in the Topical Collection: that deepfakes may cause their own demise (Sect. 5).},
